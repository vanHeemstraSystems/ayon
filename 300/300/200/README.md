# 200 - Product Types

Published products are categorized into ‘product types’ based on what is their purpose in the production. Knowing a product type should always tell you what to expect from the give publish. For example if something is marked as a ```model``` you know it passed through certain studio validations and you can expect it to be up to the studio standard, however, ```mayaScene``` doesn't provide the same confidence (because it's less strict during publishing), even though they might both actually contain the same model.

Following product type definitions and requirements are the AYON defaults and what we consider good industry practice, but most of the requirements can be altered to suit the studio or project needs. Here's a list of supported product types.
