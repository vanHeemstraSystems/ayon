# 300 - Working from home

If you are working from home though, you'll need to install it yourself. You should, however, receive the AYON installer files from your studio administrator, because AYON versions and executables might not be compatible between studios.

Installing AYON is possible by using the Installer or by unzipping downloaded ZIP archive to any drive location.

**TIP**: USING THE AYON INSTALLER<br/>
See the Installation section for more information on how to use the AYON Installer

You can run AYON by desktop "P" icon (if it exists after installing) or by directly executing **ayon_gui.exe** located in the AYON installation folder. This executable being suitable **for artists**, or alternatively by **ayon_console.exe** which is more suitable for **TDs/Admin** for debugging and error reporting. The later runs with a console window where all the necessary info will appear during user's work session.

**TIP**: IS AYON RUNNING?<br/>
AYON runs in the operating system's tray. If you see a green AYON icon in the tray you can easily tell AYON is currently running. Keep in mind that on Windows this icon might be hidden by default, in which case, the artist can simply drag the icon down to the tray.

**TIP**: ICON NOT SHOWING ON LINUX<br/>
Some Linux distributions do not ship with tray icons by defaults, mostly GNOME based, to get the icon, install the following extension: [Appindicator Support for GNOME Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)
