# 200 - Working in the studio

In studio environment you should have AYON already installed and deployed, so you can start using it without much setup. Your admin has probably put AYON icon on your desktop or even had your computer set up so AYON will start automatically.

If this is not the case, please contact your administrator to consult on how to launch AYON in your studio.
